My name is Anthony Lovenheim Irwin and I am very new to this type of work. I am excited for the course.
My goals are:
1. To become familiar with Javascript and the logic behind programing in general
2. To learn javascript in order to construct a digital map of my research data, complete with animations and visualizations.
